=> Strongly typed language: 
In strongly typed languages, every variable has a specific data type assigned to it.
Examples of strongly typed languages include Java, C++, C#, Rust, and Swift.

=> Loosely Typed Languages:
In loosely typed languages, also known as dynamically typed languages, variables can hold values of different types, 
and the language automatically handles type conversions as needed.
Examples of loosely typed languages include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Perl.

People realised that JavaScript is a very powerful language, but lacks types.
TypeScript was introduced as a new language to add types on top of JS.

What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language developed by microsoft.
It provides types to variables in JS.
TypeScript is a Superset of JavaScript: 
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, which means that all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. 
TypeScript adds optional static typing and other features on top of JavaScript.

How does TypeScript code run?
TypeScript code never runs on browser. Your browser understands JS only.
1. JS is a runtime language.
2. TS is something that transpiles down to JS.
3. When TS is converted to JS, you get type checking. If there is an error, the conversion to JS fails.
    main.ts --> tsc --> main.js --> browser.
So, in summary, TypeScript code itself never runs directly in the browser or any other runtime environment. 
It is first transpiled (converted) into plain JavaScript code, and this generated JavaScript code is what ultimately gets executed.

What is transpilation? 
Transpilation, also known as source-to-source translation, refers to the process of converting source code from one programming 
language to another programming language that has a similar level of abstraction. 

TypeScript compiler tsc:
tsc is the official TS compiler that you can use to convert TS code to JS.

install TS => npm i typescript

Setting up node with TS => npm init -y
                           npm tsc --init  
we will get a package.json and tsconfig.json files.
tsconfig.json is a configuration file used by the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to manage the compilation process of TypeScript code. 
It specifies various options and settings that affect how TypeScript files are transpiled into JavaScript.


npm vs npx => node package manager and node package executable
using npx we can use the modules without installing them locally.

Structure of .ts files in Node app:
1. create a 'src' folder
2. In this src folder write all the TS code.
3. create a 'dist' or 'build' to store .js files.
4. Goto tsconfig.json and:
   a. de-comment 'rootDir' to 'rootDir: "./src" '
   b. de-comment 'outDir' to 'outDir: "./dist" '  => never push this dist folder to github

To transpile this code enter "tsc -b" in the terminal and a .js file will be created
To run the code we need to run that .js file => node dist/a.js
